# Term 1, Week 2
Upload of work done during week 2, 12/10/2020 to 18/10/2020.

See Issue [#12](https://github.com/r-preston/MPhysProject2021/issues/12) for summary document of work done (pdf). Contains pdfs of plots created, risk assessment, and notes on the codes uploaded here. Notes on the codes have been included below.

Work done this week relates to Issues 1 to 4.

## 15/10/2020
* [ZMassAttempt1510_CalculatesZMass_noplot.py](ZMassAttempt1510_CalculatesZMass_noplot.py)

-> This is the first attempt at coding to find Z mass. Comparison of maths from own working to TLorentzVector method. Gives same values, but not Z mass here; gives M^2. This is corrected in later code. Was not able to work out how to plot a histogram at this time, but this was solved in the later code:

## 16/10/2020
* [ZMassAttempt_Maths.py](ZMassAttempt_Maths.py) - *Working code maths*
* [ZMassAttempt_ROOT.py](ZMassAttempt_ROOT.py) -  *Working code using TLorentzVector*

ZMassAttempt_ROOT.py is probably not the most efficient method, and I intend to have another go at this code using comments from Issue#3.
*Improved version uploaded T1 W4, [ZMass_Final.py](https://github.com/r-preston/MPhysProject2021/blob/master/laura-progress/T1_W4/ZMass_Final.py)*

Histograms as uploaded to comment on [Issue#3](https://github.com/r-preston/MPhysProject2021/issues/3).
Histograms could be better presented, I intend to investigate methods for better layout.
