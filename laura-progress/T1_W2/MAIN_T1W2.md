# Term 1, Week 2
Upload of work done during week 2, 12/10/2020 to 18/10/2020.

* [Main Record of Work (Week 2)](T1_W2_Doc.pdf)
* [Photos of written notes (Week 2)](T1_W2_Written_Notes.pdf)

Main Record contains lists of activities attempted each day, a reference table to the relevant page in the written notes, and a reference table for the uploaded documents. Contains notes about other files uploaded, which have been listed under the relevant date in the main record document.

Work done this week relates to Issues 1 to 4.

## 14/10/2020
* [RISK ASSESSMENT](Project_risk_assessment_LCairns.xlsx)

## 15/10/2020
* [Project Lookup Document](Project_Lookup_Doc.pdf) - *Contains tables of common code, glossary, key ideas*
* [ZMassAttempt1510_CalculatesZMass_noplot.py](ZMassAttempt1510_CalculatesZMass_noplot.py)

-> This is the first attempt at coding to find Z mass. Comparison of maths from own working to TLorentzVector method. Gives same values, but not Z mass here; gives M^2. This is corrected in later code. Was not able to work out how to plot a histogram at this time, but this was solved in the later code:

## 16/10/2020
* [ZMassAttempt_Maths.py](ZMassAttempt_Maths.py) - *Working code maths*
* [ZMassAttempt_ROOT.py](ZMassAttempt_ROOT.py) -  *Working code using TLorentzVector*
* [Histogram produced by ZMassAttempt_Maths.py](ZMassPlot_Maths.pdf)
* [Histogram produced by ZMassAttempt_ROOT.py](ZMassPlots_ROOT.pdf)

ZMassAttempt_ROOT.py is probably not the most efficient method, and I intend to have another go at this code using comments from Issue#3.

Histograms as uploaded to comment on [Issue#3](https://github.com/r-preston/MPhysProject2021/issues/3).
Histograms could be better presented, I intend to investigate methods for better layout.
